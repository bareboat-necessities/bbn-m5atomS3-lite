# NMEA-0183 XDR Sensors on ESP32 m5atomS3-lite

NMEA-0183 XDR Sensors on m5atomS3-lite for Arduino IDE.

The sensors stream NMEA-0183 XDR sentences via USB

## Sensors:

- Temperature 1-wire
- Temperature i2c
- Humidity i2c
- Air Pressure i2c
- Voltage i2c
- Illuminance i2c
- Liquid Level 4-20mA current

## TODO:

- Lightning detector sensor
- UV Light intencity
- Range (Time of Flight)
- Current (Amp Meter)
- RPM Meter
- Compass
- Boat Pitch and Roll
