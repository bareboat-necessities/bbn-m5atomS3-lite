# Engine Oil Pressure with m5stack atomS3-lite

Typically boat Engine Oil Pressure sensors are resistive (240-33 Ohms or 0-180 Ohms)

You can use https://github.com/bareboat-necessities/bbn-m5atomS3-lite/tree/main/bbn_m5atomS3_lite_resistance_Ohm
to generate NMEA XDR messages and tune your data for your boat oil pressure sensor with
